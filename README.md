# Simba iOS

Simba is a personal AI assistant. This repository is the iPhone front end, starting with a clean, social-style email client experience.

Phase 1 is a minimal email client:
- Inbox feed with card-based layout
- Thread view for replies
- Read and reply UI (no AI actions yet)

## Design

See `design.md` for product scope, interaction model, and UI direction. Backend context lives in `DESIGN-backend.md`.

## Repo Status

This repo currently contains design references and mockups. App implementation will follow the Phase 1 spec.

## Assets

Mockups and reference images live at repo root. These guide the feed-like email UI.
